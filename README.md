This repo is forked from the SuperDARN/control_programs repo. Here this repo will
contain radar specific changes in order to easily deploy control program changes
to the radars.  Radar specific code will be stored on *radar*-operations branches.
If there are new/developing control programs, the branch will be named off of the
base developing branch.  For example, the interleavesound branch for Fort Hays
will be stored on:
interleavesound-fhr


Note from original repo:

This repository contains an archive of SuperDARN radar control programs.
Please contact the control program author or experiment requester with any questions.
